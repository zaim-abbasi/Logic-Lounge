Welcome to Logic-Lounge, where coding meets casual banter! üöÄ

## About
Logic-Lounge is an interactive platform for real-time communication between users using Java sockets. It's a coding conversation hub, enabling programmers to discuss code, logic, share tech insights, and connect with fellow developers within a shared local network with NO INTERNET ACCESS.

## Features

- **Discussion Space**: Discuss coding problems, issues, errors, and more with your fellow programmers.
- **Friendly Atmosphere**: Enjoy a casual and friendly space for discussing algorithms, syntax, and all things code-related.
- **Real-time Interaction**: Experience real-time communication with fellow developers within the local network. Connect multiple clients to a central server, allowing seamless interaction, message exchange, and collaboration on coding projects.

## How It Works

1. **Setup the Server**: Run the `Server.java` on your system's localhost.
2. **Client Connection**: Launch the `Client.java`, pick a unique username, and enter the Logic-Lounge. Ensure all clients are on the same local Wifi or Ethernet network as the server.
3. **Local Communication**: Share code, thoughts, or seek advice within the local network. The client automatically connects to the server, fostering collaborative coding discussions.
4. **Server Operation**: Run the client to check server status. If no server is running, execute `Server.java` to create one on localhost. Clients connect automatically.
5. **Maintain Server Presence**: Keep the server running for continuous client connections and seamless communication.
6. **Local Network Setup**: Perfect for communicating within a shared local network, ideal when all users are connected to the same Wifi or Ethernet network without internet access.

## Setup for Local Communication

This project allows communication on a shared network without internet access. Set up a server on one machine in the system and connect all clients to the same Wifi or Ethernet network.

- Run the client to check if the server is up.
- If no server is running, execute `Server.java` to create a server on localhost.
- Clients can connect and communicate within the local network.

## Important Note

Keep the server running at all times for clients to connect, disconnect, and communicate. The project is designed for communication in environments without internet access.
